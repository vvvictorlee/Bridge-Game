The list is not in priority order

-Think of a way to implement the "dummy"
	The dummy is the partner of the contractor
	For the duration of a Deal, the contractor plays his hand (when it is his turn) and the dumy's (when it is the dummy's)
	The dummy's hand is public (everybody can see it)
	
-Add double and redouble contracts

-Maybe have != possibilities for ending game (reach a certain amount of points, do a number of deals, play for some time ..

- Multiplayer and Singleplayer Game interface

- Croupier
